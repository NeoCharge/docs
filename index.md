## Product Perspective
For EV (electric vehicle) owners, charging their vehicle comprises a significant part of their EV ownership experience. NeoCharge helps alleviate some of the overall cost for EV owners, creates a charge with less impact on the environment, and provides a simple and non-costly setup. Currently, NeoCharge only provides their customers with charging hardware that begins charging the car immediately after being plugged in. Our mobile application will give owners of NeoCharge EV chargers more insight into and control over the charging process. We want users of NeoCharge products to be able to control and view their products without needing to be anywhere near the hardware they have purchased.

## Product Features
All of the major features that will be implemented into the NeoCharge app will fall into two basic categories, those that give the user insight into the charging process, and those that control and schedule charging sessions. 

### Insight into the charging process:
- Let the user view:
  - their charging history (including recently paid prices)
  - their power usages, and how green their usage of power was. 
  - the status of current charging sessions. In addition, users can 
- Add more than one vehicle/device

### Control over the charging session:
- Users will be able to set limits on when they would want to charge
- Users will also have the option to start a charging session right away
